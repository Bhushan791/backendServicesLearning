1) >> docker run -it ubuntu 

desc: make a new image conatiner having OS linux-ubuntu (we got whole new os like )


2) 
to - restart any existing containers 
>> docker ps -a
>> docker start -i containerID/imagename
it shows the container id andthen activtes it
 
3) docker exec  <container_name> <cmd>


##port mapping 
Port mapping = exposing a container’s internal port to your host machine so you can access it.
cmd: 

example :
>docker run -it piyushgargdev/mynodeapp
above cmd will run in 800 but not  in our machine only inside  that container  so we cannot  actually access it.. so we use port:port 

4)>> docker run it -p port:port name-of-container
where left port is host port and right port is container port 




5) BUILD the docker file 
>> docker build -t learn-nodejs . 
< -t is tag> and [. is path ]


6)  to run the container again we use the command no.4


7) to enter inside that container we use  

>> docker exec -it <containerID(initial letters aslo okay)> bash 

shoudshow something like <root@id> 

8) setting enviroments / override details 

>>  docker run -it -e PORT=4000 -p 4000:4000 <image-name> 



### dockerfile vs yaml file

Dockerfile = build an image; YAML (Compose) = orchestrate/run multiple containers.


##PUBLISH IMAGE --> 
steps
- need account of hub.docker.com  >create repo 
- come to the project, do this now username matters copyfrom there
 cmd >> docker build -t bhushan121222222222/learn-nodejs .
- now you have putted local build of docker to docker hub one (just like git remote add and commit) 

- login to docker [command: >> docker login >>[no id pass needed if continued from google]] 

-now to push actually 
cmd >> docker push bhushan121222222222/learn-nodejs







#### DOCKER compose [multiple containers SETUP, CREATE, DESTROY]
in real world we need to run multiple containers simultaneously like 
seperate for (postgres, redis, mailhog, kafka )all with diff PORTS in a single project so  we need a file to write pipeline forthis.


now make a [docker-compose.yaml] file write pipeline and configuration there and run by this cmd :
>> docker compose up

[now we can see in docker desktop one stack having 2 containers running]

cmd >> docker compose down [removes whatevr the UP command made]

cmd : docker compose up -d [detached mode run in bg no need of active terminal and can also use DOWN cmd to stop/remove]
