throughput of DBs is very low 
throughput--> number of operations per given period (OPS)


throughput of kafka is very high  
but kafka dosent have storage 
while,
Db has large storage 




##case Study for UBER 

>> The various uber vehicles are generating the data per sec (every sec millions) 

>> now kafka process/stores it easily (becuase of its high throughput) and now kafka can send the data to **consumers**..

WHO are consumers.. --> the other seperate services who rely on same data to function.
suppose the driver data (speed, location, stops, pauses) all are needed for following seperate works
1) FARE calculation
2) Analysis of ride 
3) Customers getting informations  etc.. 


now the whole bulk insert will happen (may it can take a bit more time but it is definitly faster than inserting everysec which can potentially crash the DB)
